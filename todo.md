# Did not need it
- [ ] object type
- [ ] variable definitions as structs

# Code refactoring
- [ ] Parameters code dupltication
- [ ] Function arguments are called parameters, and these names are inconsistent throughout the code.
- [ ] Type conversion
- [ ] make all the String outputs from the `parse` function return Al objects instead
- [ ] remove allow(dead_code)
- [ ] ArtelType should be just vector of types, no need to distinguish between one element and many
- [ ] Refactor common things, like identified from "name" and stuff
- [ ] refactor out "cursor" which is used one time
- [ ] refactor identifiers

# Ideas
- [ ] Identifier conversion

# Big questions
- [x] Void problem... Void = anything but ignored, not undefined...
- [x] arbitrary expression in default values to the function
- [x] Indexable types?
- [x] Abstract stuff?
