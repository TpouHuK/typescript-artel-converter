# Code refactoring

- [ ] Function arguments are called parameters, and these names are inconsistent throughout the code.
- [ ] Type conversion
- [ ] make all the String outputs from the `parse` function return Al objects instead
- [ ] remove allow(dead_code)
- [ ] ArtelType should be just vector of types, no need to distinguish between one element and many


# Ideas
